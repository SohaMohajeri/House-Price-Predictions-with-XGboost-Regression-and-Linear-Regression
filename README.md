In this Notebook, we will work on a dataset that contains house sale prices for King County in Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It is a great dataset for evaluating regression models.

Here, we will use two different regression methods and try to predict the house prices by using them. 
First, we will implement XGBoost as an ensemble learning algorithm to predict the the house prices. Afterwards, we will build a model by Linear Regression. Finally, we will compare the results of these two models to find the best model.
